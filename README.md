# **Streamlit-AI-Apps: Object Detection, Speech Recognition & Image/Video Colorization** 🎯  

This project is a **web-based AI suite** that provides multiple functionalities for processing images, videos, and audio files.  
It includes:  

✅ **Object Detection** using YOLO  
✅ **Speech Recognition** using Whisper  
✅ **Image & Video Colorization** using a deep learning model  

The application is built with **Streamlit** as the user interface and utilizes AI libraries such as  
**PyTorch, OpenCV, MoviePy, Whisper, YOLO, and pydub**.

## **🚀 Features**  

### 🔍 Object Detection  
- Detects objects in images and videos using **YOLO**.  
- Draws bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores.  
- Supports **JPG, PNG, MP4, AVI, MOV** formats.  

### 🎙 Speech Recognition  
- Converts **audio files to text** using **Whisper AI**.  
- Supports formats like **MP3, WAV, MP4, OGG, AAC, FLAC, FLV**.  
- Allows choosing the **Whisper model size** for better performance.  

### 🎨 Image & Video Colorization  
- Colorizes **grayscale images and videos** using a deep learning model.  
- Processes videos **frame-by-frame** using `MoviePy`.  
- Supports **JPG, PNG, MP4** formats.
